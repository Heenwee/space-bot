This is the code for the discord bot andromeda, it needs a couple things done to be able to run, but i warn you, this bot might be hard to get running
first, install the requirements.txt file with pip
read thru setup.txt and to everything in there
and run build.py in order to get a library
  -> build.py requries rust to be installed
  -> "curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh"
  
lastly fill in the missing entries for keys.env
