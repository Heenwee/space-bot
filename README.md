This is the code for the discord bot andromeda, it needs a couple things done to be able to run, but i warn you, this bot might be hard to get running

you need to have a verified top.gg bot or else this will throw an error :p

first, install the requirements.txt file with pip

read thru setup.txt and to everything in there

and run build.py in order to get a library

  -> build.py requries rust to be installed
  
  -> "curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh"



lastly fill in the these entries in a file named keys.env

TOP_GG_PORT= you need to port forward your sever with a port i don't remember the exact ports but keep it between 5000 and 45000 and you should be good
